This is a WordPress plugin that fixes a WP bug: "pretty" search URLs containing encoded spaces (e.g. http://example.com/search/boo%20radley) are not correctly decoded and so do not work.

The bug is covered at http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13961

This bug will eventually be fixed (hopefully during the second half of 2011). After that this plugin will no longer be needed.
