This is a WordPress plugin that fixes a WP bug: "pretty" search URLs
containing encoded spaces
(e.g. http://example.com/search/boo%20radley) are not correctly
decoded and so do not work.

The bug is covered at http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13961

Warning: once this bug is fixed (maybe in WP 3.3) this plugin may
possibly cause some search URLs to fail.
